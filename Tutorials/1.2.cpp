Write a program to calculate the amount to be paid for a rented vehicle.
� Input the distance the van has travelled
� The first 30 km is at a rate of 50/= per km.
� The remaining distance is calculated at the rate of 40/= per km.
e.g.
Distance -> 20
Amount = 20 x 50 = 1000
Distance -> 50
Amount = 30 x 50 + (50-30) x 40 = 2300  */
